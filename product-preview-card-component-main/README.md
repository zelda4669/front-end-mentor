## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media properties

### What I learned

This was my first time building a site with responsive design and media elements in CSS. Getting the image to size appropriately and sub out based on the size of the device was the most complex, but I am happy with the result!

### Continued development

When approaching this project, I started by doing what I already knew -- a desktop view for the site. Then I started researching how to make the page responsive for mobile and learned about mobile-first design. I'm looking forward to approaching my next project from that perspective.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) has an excellent tutorial on responsive images -- it's comprehensive but still extremely approachable for a newbie (like me!)
